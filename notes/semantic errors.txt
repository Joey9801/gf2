Format of the following:
  Nature of the error - is it recoverable, if so how
All errors are to be reported if possible. Unrecoverable only means that the network wont run after parsing


Cannot open included file (might not exist, wrong permissions, etc..) - unrecoverable only if the include is actually used

Included definitions form a directed cycle (eg A include B which include A) - unrecoverable, the definition is meaningless.

Initial input value could be invalid - recoverable default to false

input_name doesn't exist - recoverable, ignore it

input of a gate is not connected to anything - recoverable, default to false

dest_component_nickname doesn't exist - recoverable, treat as unconnected/connected to const.false

dest_output_name is not an output of dest_component_name - recoverable, treat as unconnected/connected to const.false

not appending [.dest_output_name] if there are multiple outputs - recoverable, treat as unconnected/connected to const.false

component_type is not a valid component or include - unrecoverable

same component_nickname appears twice - unrecoverable

same input_nickname appears twice - unrecoverable

same output_nickname appears twice - unrecoverable

same monitor_point_nickname appears twice - unrecoverable

same input_name is connected more than once in the same component block - unrecoverable

root components field missing - unrecoverable

any of the other root fields missing - recoverable (no ambiguity, maybe warn?)
