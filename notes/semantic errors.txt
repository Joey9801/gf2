dest_component_nickname doesn't exist - unrecoverable

dest_output_name is not an output of dest_component_name - unrecoverable

not appending [.dest_output_name] if there are multiple outputs - unrecoverable

component_type is not a valid component or include - unrecoverable

same input_nickname appears twice - unrecoverable

same output_nickname appears twice - unrecoverable
